This is a project I created out of Techworld with Nana's IT Fundamentals course. This very simplistic web application consists of a frontend written in Javascript using the VueJS framework and the backend using the NodeJS framework. We used MongoDB as the NoSQL distributed database to persist the data and secured database access by configuring credentials.
